            <h1>How to Play</h1>
            <p id="htp">Use WASD to move. Try your best to avoid the hazards and see how far you can get! Although, every 4 attacks, the game will start to speed up. Occasionally, you will run into some Mix-Ups. These Mix-Ups will alter the game for a few rounds, adding another layer of challenge.</p>
