Optimism is an arcade-esque endless "game" where you dodge obstacles that are synced to music. Over time, the music will get faster and so will the obstacles. The goal of the game is simply to just see how far you can get before the obstacles get too fast for you and you pass out I guess.

If you really want to, you can play the game [here.](naturalitee.github.io/optimism)
